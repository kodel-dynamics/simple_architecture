# Shared

In this folder you keep all things that are shared among different parts of your application.

It's a good idea to apply some unit-tests for these components, if possible.

Examples:

* Widgets that can be used in multiple places, such as a stylized button, etc.
* Utility methods, such as DateTime handling, extension methods, etc.
