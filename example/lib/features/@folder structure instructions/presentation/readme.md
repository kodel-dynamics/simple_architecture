# Presentation

In this folder you keep all your widgets, pages, etc. that belongs to a specific feature (common/shared widgets, such as `ColoredCard`, goes into the shared folder).

You should write Flutter widget tests for all things in this folder.

Examples:

* `LoginPage` for a widget that implements a complete page about log in users.
* `CustomerList` for a widget that shows a list of customers.
